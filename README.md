(Netbeans with Maven) Unifying and simplifying application workbooks building

A library with tools to generate plain workbooks (sheets and cells) using a friendly interface.
The idea is to use XLS/ODS file format to generate report sheets with header/footer, title rows, detail rows and total rows, not dealing too much with fonts, cellstyles or any advanced feature. Just a cheap report tool to Java applications.

I'm starting using only Apache POI dependency to generate XLS files. Later I'll integrate another dependency to work with ODS.

This is my first project with Maven and my first in github too. Feel free to make positive criticism.

And sorry my poor English....
